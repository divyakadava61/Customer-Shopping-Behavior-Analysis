# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
## 1. Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw dataset ingestion to delivering actionable business insights through dashboards and reports.

The project covers:

Data loading and preprocessing using Python

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data cleaning and transformation

SQL querying using SQL Server

Interactive dashboard development in Power BI

Business report creation

Presentation development using Gamma

The goal of this project is to showcase practical skills in data analysis, data visualization, and business storytelling.

## 2. Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains structured data relevant to business analysis (e.g., sales, customers, operations, or performance metrics).

Key characteristics:

Structured tabular format (CSV/Excel/Database)

Multiple numerical and categorical variables

Business-related KPIs (e.g., revenue, transactions, customer behavior, trends)

The dataset was used to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that support data-driven decision-making.

## 3. Tools & Technologies
Tool	Purpose
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)	Data loading, cleaning, and EDA
SQL Server	Data querying, aggregation, filtering
Power BI	Dashboard creation and visualization
Gamma	Presentation (PPT) development
Jupyter Notebook	Analysis environment
## 4. Project Workflow / Steps
### Step 1: Data Loading (Python)

Imported dataset using Pandas

Inspected structure (shape, columns, data types)

Checked for null values and duplicates

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics (mean, median, distribution)

### Step 3: Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Standardized column formats

Converted data types

Created derived features

### Step 4: SQL Analysis (SQL Server)

Imported cleaned dataset into SQL Server

Wrote SQL queries for:

Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)

Grouped analysis

Filtering and sorting

Window Functions, CTEs

Extracted business metrics for reporting

### Step 5: Power BI Dashboard

Connected SQL Server to Power BI / cleaned dataset

Built interactive dashboards including:

KPI cards

Trend analysis charts

Category breakdowns

Filters & slicers

DAX Calculations

### Step 6: Report & Presentation

Created a structured business report summarizing:

Key insights

Data trends

Recommendations

Designed a presentation using Gamma to communicate findings clearly to stakeholders

## 5. Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard includes:

📈 Revenue / Performance trends over time

📊 Category-wise breakdown

👥 Customer or segment analysis

🎯 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

🔎 Interactive filters for dynamic exploration

The dashboard is designed to support decision-makers in identifying patterns, opportunities, and improvement areas.
